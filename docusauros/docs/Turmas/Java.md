Java Roadmap

🌱 Beginner Level (Basics & Syntax)

Focus: Variables, conditionals, loops, basic input/output.
    1. Simple Calculator
        ○ Perform basic arithmetic operations based on user input.
    2. Number Guessing Game
        ○ Generate a random number and have the user guess it.
    3. Even or Odd Checker
        ○ Take a number input and check if it's even or odd.
    4. Multiplication Table
        ○ Print the multiplication table for a number (up to 10 or 12).
    5. Palindrome Checker
        ○ Check if a given string or number is a palindrome.

🛠️ Intermediate Level (OOP & Collections)
Focus: Classes/Objects, inheritance, arrays, ArrayList, file I/O.
    6. Bank Account System
        ○ Create a class for bank accounts with deposit, withdraw, and check balance functions.
    7. Student Grade Management
        ○ Use an ArrayList or array to manage students and grades; calculate average, highest, etc.
    8. Library Book System
        ○ Classes for Book, Library; include search, borrow, and return features.
    9. To-Do List App
        ○ Allow adding, removing, and marking tasks using a list.
    10. Simple File Logger
    • Read and write user actions to a text file.

🚀 Advanced Level (GUI, Threads, Networking, Lambda)
Focus: GUI with Swing/JavaFX, concurrency, lambdas, streams.
    11. Chat Application (Console or GUI)
    • Basic networking using Socket and ServerSocket.
    12. Multithreaded Download Simulator
    • Use threads to simulate file downloads or task processing.
    13. GUI Calculator
